# Tinder Swap Card

This is a project based on ***@midudev*** tutorial from **100 JavaScript Projects**

Things that I've done:

* Added more people
* Replace the way that the cards appear by creating a function called cardRender()
* You can add people way easier by just updating the data array
* Added functionality and an animation to the reload button

TODO:

* [ ] Implement a JSON data structure for the cards
* [ ] Implement functionality for all the buttons
* [ ] Implement a loading skeleton
